The Council of the District of Columbia places most of its legislative records on its website in an application known as Legislative Information Management System, or "LIMS."

*limsy* is a project to build a RESTful API for LIMS data. It's primarily borne of various internal use cases, where accessing specific data is essential. But I anticipate it could serve many other uses.
